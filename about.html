                        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>Cooking has always been more than just a hobby for meâ€”it's a way to express creativity and bring people together. I enjoy spending my free time experimenting with different cuisines, perfecting my culinary skills, and discovering new flavours. Additionally, I have a keen interest in design and technology, often exploring new tools and techniques to enhance my projects. Whether it's working on a new recipe, planning an event, or diving into a design project, I find joy in the process of creating and learning.</p>

                        <h3>Volunteering</h3>
                        <p>Volunteering is an integral part of my life, where I have had the privilege of organising and participating in various charitable events. I have been actively involved in fundraising initiatives such as the Biggest Morning Tea and the RSPCA Cupcake Day, where I combined my love for baking with a commitment to giving back to the community. These experiences have taught me the importance of teamwork, leadership, and the impact that a collective effort can have in supporting worthy causes.</p>

                        <h3>Interests</h3>
                        <p>With a strong passion for education and culinary arts, I am deeply interested in exploring the intersection of food technology and teaching. I enjoy experimenting with new recipes, especially those that incorporate Indigenous Australian ingredients, and I love finding ways to merge traditional techniques with modern flavours. My interest in design innovation also drives me to constantly seek creative solutions, whether in the kitchen or the classroom, aiming to make learning engaging and accessible for all students.</p>

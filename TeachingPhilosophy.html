            <p>Welcome to my teaching philosophy page. Here, I share my beliefs and approaches to teaching, which are fundamental to my practice as an educator. My philosophy is centered around creating a dynamic and inclusive learning environment that fosters curiosity and critical thinking.</p>

                <p>I believe that every student has the potential to succeed, and it is my role to provide the necessary support and encouragement to help them reach their goals. A student-centered approach, where each student's individual needs and learning styles are considered, is essential in achieving this. By employing a variety of teaching methods and strategies, I aim to engage all students and cater to their diverse needs. I also believe in engaging in school extracurricular activities so that students can engage with important initiatives. At Punchbowl Boys High School I work with students in the 'cooking club' where students learn to cook. I also enjoy being a part of initiatives such as book week.</p>

                </span>
                <p>In my teaching practice, I prioritize interactive and hands-on learning experiences that promote active participation. I use project-based learning, collaborative group work, and real-world applications to make lessons relevant and engaging. Additionally, I incorporate formative assessments to gauge student understanding and adjust instruction accordingly. I also ensure students understand the importance of understanding computer programs and assist them in developing solutions.</p>

                <p>Continual professional growth is crucial for maintaining effective teaching practices. I am committed to engaging in ongoing professional development opportunities to stay current with educational trends and best practices. This commitment ensures that I can provide the highest quality education to my students and adapt to the evolving needs of the classroom.</p>
